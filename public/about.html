<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Abdulaziz Aldhubayban, an Information Science student at King Saud University’s College of Computer and Information Sciences. My academic journey is focused on information systems, data management, and software development, with a growing interest in project management and cybersecurity. Beyond coursework, I actively engage in specialized training programs and certifications that strengthen both my technical expertise and professional skill set.</p>

<p>Alongside my studies, I’ve gained hands-on experience through internships and case studies, particularly in project management and digital transformation initiatives. My work with corporate PMO frameworks and technology solutions—such as digital ID and access management systems—has sharpened my ability to bridge technical solutions with organizational goals. I enjoy working on structured deliverables like business cases, risk registers, and system designs, and I value collaboration across diverse teams to achieve impactful results.</p>

<p>Outside academics and professional projects, I am passionate about continuous learning and personal development. Whether it’s exploring global cultures through travel, maintaining a healthy lifestyle through fitness, or experimenting with new software projects, I believe growth comes from curiosity and discipline. My long-term goal is to contribute to Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 by driving forward initiatives in digital innovation, sustainable practices, and data-driven decision making.</p>
